Here is a **fully polished, portfolio-ready README** with clear structure, professional tone, and strong presentation. It’s tailored to show your strengths as an advanced gameplay programmer.

# **Weapon Systems Prototype – Unity**

A prototype demonstrating my weapon creation and first-person systems in Unity, originally built around a single weapon (M4) and later expanded based on feedback.
Features include procedural animation, BF2042-style weapon inspection, attachment switching, and modular weapon logic.

---

## **🎯 Project Purpose**

This project serves as a **portfolio piece** to showcase my ability to design and implement scalable first-person weapon systems.
It highlights:

* Clean, readable, and customizable gameplay code
* Procedural recoil and animation
* Modular weapon data and logic
* Tools-focused thinking for creating reusable systems

---

## **🛠️ Implemented Features**

### **M4 Assault Rifle (Completed)**

* BF2042-style weapon inspection animation
* Procedural recoil + camera kick
* Attachment switching (sights/optics)
* Customizable weapon stats through inspector variables
* Smooth Lerp-based transitions and handling

### **Core Weapon System**

* Modular weapon data
* Input handling
* Firing logic
* Reload + animation events
* Weapon sway/ADS logic
* Customizable feel & tuning parameters

---

## **📌 Work in Progress**

### **RPG Launcher**

* Basic firing logic
* Explosion VFX
* Procedural animation pass (WIP)

### **Sniper Rifle**

* Not started
* Planned features: scope overlay, lens distortion, bolt cycling animation

---

## **🔧 Planned Refactoring**

After all three weapons (M4, RPG, Sniper) are implemented, I will complete a full refactor of the core weapon system.

### **Goals for the Refactor**

* Introduce a **BaseWeapon** class
* Move all shared logic (firing, input, sway, animation hooks) into the base
* Isolate weapon-specific behavior in subclasses
* Reduce duplicate logic currently inside the M4 script
* Improve overall system scalability and readability

This will significantly increase usability and make adding future weapons much easier.

## **✨ Note on Project Evolution**

I am currently developing a **new and more refined version** of this system in a separate project.
The newer iteration focuses on:

* Cleaner architecture
* Stronger separation of concerns
* Improved game feel (animations, timing, polish)
* A more deliberate and professional implementation process

This prototype represents the earlier iteration where I rapidly prototyped ideas, systems, and animation workflows.

## **🔮 Future Additions**

* Improved attachment system
* Melee weapon support
* Inventory/weapon wheel
* Procedural reload blending
* Hit reactions and impact feedback system

If you want, I can also:
➡️ Rewrite it in a shorter, “studio-ready” format
➡️ Tailor it specifically for recruiters
➡️ Add a “Technical Breakdown” section that explains your code architecture choices
➡️ Create a clean HTML or Notion-style version for portfolio websites
