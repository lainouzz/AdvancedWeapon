# **Weapon Systems Prototype – Unity**

A prototype demonstrating my weapon creation and first-person systems in Unity, originally built around a single weapon (M4).
Features include procedural animation, BF2042-style weapon inspection, attachment switching, and modular weapon logic.

## **🎯 Project Purpose**

This project serves as a **portfolio piece** to showcase my ability to design and implement scalable first-person weapon systems.
It highlights:

* semi-clean, semi-readable, and customizable gameplay code
* Procedural recoil and animation
* Modular weapon data and logic
* Tools-focused thinking for creating reusable systems
