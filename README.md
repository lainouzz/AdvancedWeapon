# AdvancedWeapon
 A portfolio piece to showcase my Weapon creation ability

Current goal is to add two more weapons, so 3 weapons in total, M4(Done), RPG(WIP), Sniper(Not started)
Once im done with these 3 weapons, I am planning to re-factor and re-structure the main weapon code for it to be more Efficient, more structure and make increase the usability.

To make the code more Efficient I will make a "Base Weapon" class where the 3 weapons will inherit the functions from, this will decreae the amount of code needed for each weapon and no need to copy past functions from current weapon class(M4) onto the "other" weapons.

This main idea of this game was just to have ONE weapon, but now that I am done with the weapon(m4) i got suggestions to make more, so that's the plan.

The project will hopefully be done in 2-3 weeks and be optimized and structured for further uses.
